## Development Options

![Development Options](images/development-options.jpg)

The UCM [development options](../ucm/development-options.md) can greatly simplify the process of building a product or prototype using the UC5550.  Options include a development board and displays which can get you programming in minutes.

## .NET Micro Framework (NETMF)

The NETMF software on G400 is mature and complete. For more information on NETMF you can go to the [NETMF Introduction](../../software/netmf/intro.md) page.  The [NETMF Getting Started](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md) page covers NETMF from setup of the host computer to program deployment on both an emulator and target device.

Bootloader v1 is needed for G400 to work with NETMF. It is available in the NETMF SDK.

### Loading Bootloader

Download the [G400 bootloader file](../../software/netmf/bootloader.md) and load onto the dataflash using the Microchip (Atmel) [SAM-BA tool](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/PartNO/SAM-BA%20In-system%20Programmer) and the following instructions.

To set the chip in SAM-BA mode, hold down the dedicated button on your board (SYS A on UCM Dev and Breakout boards) while the system powers up (or during reset). If there is no such button, connect G400D pin SPI1_MISO to ground. Keep the button pressed (pin grounded) for three seconds after power up or reset, then release the pin. The device manager will show a COM port similar to "Bossa Program Port" or "GPS Detect".

1. If it is not already installed, download and install the [SAM-BA tool](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/PartNO/SAM-BA%20In-system%20Programmer) from Microchip. The latest version we have tested is 2.18 for Windows. (The tool may not show correctly. Try to make the window larger to see all hidden buttons!)
2. Open the SAM-BA program then select the COM port for your device in the connection box and your board type below it (at91sam9x35-ek for G400), then click connect.
3. Near the middle of the window, go to the `DataFlash AT45DB/DCB` tab.
4. Under `Scripts`, select `Enable Dataflash (SPI0 CS0)` then click the `Execute` button.
5. Under `Scripts`, select `Erase All` then click `Execute`. This will take some time to complete.  It seems that if SAM-BA loses focus during the erase procedure it can seem to lock up.  We recommend that once you click the `Execute` button you leave the computer alone until the erase procedure is completed.
6. Under `Scripts`, select `Send Boot File`, click execute, then browse to and select the bootloader for the device.
7. Once the transfer finishes, go to `File` > `Quit` and then reset the board. Make sure to properly quit the program or connection errors may result on subsequent uses.
8. Now reset the board.  Congratulations, your board is now running the loaded program!

### Loading the Firmware

1. Activate the bootloader, hold the LDR0 signal (SYS B) low while resetting the board.
2. Open the FEZ Config tool and follow the instructions.

You can also update the firmware manually. Download the [firmware](../../software/netmf/downloads.md) and learn how to use the [GHI Electronics Bootloader](../../software/netmf/bootloader.md) manually.

### Start Coding

Now that you have installed the bootloader and firmware, you can setup your host computer and start programming.  Go to the NETMF [Getting Started](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md) page for instructions.

## Datasheet
This documentation page replaced the legacy datasheet PDF but it is [here](http://files.ghielectronics.com/downloads/Documents/Datasheets/G400S%20and%20G400D%20Datasheet.pdf) for reference.

## G400D Pinout

Many signals on the G400D are multiplexed to offer multiple functions on a single pin. Developers can decide on the pin functionality to be used through the provided libraries. Any pin with no name, function, or note must be left unconnected.

## CAN Bit Timing Settings

The following CAN bit timing parameters were calculated for a G400 driving the SN65HVD230 CAN driver chip. See the [CAN Tutorial](../../software/netmf/tutorials/can.md) for more information.

| Baud | Propagation | Phase1 | Phase2 | Baudrate Prescaler | Synchronization Jump Width | Use Multi Bit Sampling | Sample Point | Max Osc. Tolerance | Max Cable Length
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
| 83.333K | 7 | 4 | 1 | 99 | 0 | False | 87.5% | 0.31% | 845M
| 125K    | 7 | 1 | 1 | 81 | 0 | False | 84.6% | 0.38% | 499M
| 250K    | 7 | 1 | 1 | 40 | 0 | False | 84.6% | 0.38% | 222M
| 500K    | 7 | 7 | 1 | 13 | 1 | False | 89.5% | 0.41% | 92M
| 1M      | 7 | 7 | 1 | 6  | 1 | False | 89.5% | 0.41% | 19M

*Note: Maximum Oscillator Tolerance and Maximum Cable Length are theoretical maximums and must be tested to ensure reliability.*
