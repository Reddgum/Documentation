# MQTT
---

MQTT is a light weight messaging protocol for sensors that is supported by all major cloud services. See the following cloud provider pages for further details: [Azure](azure.md), [AWS](aws.md) and [Google Cloud](google-cloud.md).

The following is a simple example of MQTT:

>[!TIP]
>Needed Nugets: GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Networking.Mqtt

```cs
var caCertificate = new X509Certificate(UTF8Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Your certificate"));

var mqttHost = "your_host";
var mqttPort = 8883; //default 8883
var deviceId = "your_device_id";

var username = "your_username";
var password = "your_password";
var topic = "your_topic";

try {
    var clientSetting = new MqttClientSetting {
        BrokerName = mqttHost,
        BrokerPort = mqttPort,
        ClientCertificate = null,
        CaCertificate = caCertificate,
        SslProtocol = System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.Tls12
    };

    var client = new Mqtt(clientSetting);

    var connectSetting = new MqttConnectionSetting {
        ClientId = deviceId,
        UserName = username,
        Password = password
    };

    // Connect to host
    var returnCode = client.Connect(connectSetting);

    var packetId = 1;
                
    // Subscribe to a topic
    client.Subscribe(new string[] { topic }, new QoSLevel[] { QoSLevel.ExactlyOnce },
        (ushort)packetId++);

    // Publish a topic
    client.Publish(topic, Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("your message"), QoSLevel.MostOnce,
        false, (ushort)packetId);
}
catch (Exception e) { 
}
```

>[!NOTE]
> The MQTT driver in TinyCLR OS supports client mode only.

# Event Handler

The Mqtt driver provides five events:

```cs
client.PublishReceivedChanged += (a,b) => { Debug.WriteLine("Publish Received Changed.");  };
client.PublishedChanged += (a, b, c) => { Debug.WriteLine("Published Changed."); }; ;
client.SubscribedChanged += (a, b) => { Debug.WriteLine("Subscribed Changed."); };
client.ConnectedChanged += (a) => { Debug.WriteLine("Connected Changed."); };
client.UnsubscribedChanged += (a, b) => { Debug.WriteLine("Unsubscribed Changed."); };
```
